        <h2 class="title">Rock stable</h2>
        <p>
          the goal is to provide long-term supported system receiving security
          updates. This is exactly what Debian base guarantees. We prefer the
          Debian development model to keep the core system as immutable as possible.
          It results in a reliable and stable system that you can definitely
          rely on .. read more

        <h2 class="title">Dual desktop ready</h2>
        <p>
          a unique alternative that makes possible setting up multiple desktop
          environments, typically Plasma and Trinity, side by side without
          interfering with each other. Carefully separated, ready to run as
          required, waiting for action. Just select the desired one at login

            <h2>Trinity desktop option</h2>
            <p>
              ightweight, fast, efficient, in many ways surpasses competition.
              In our opinion, a highly underrated desktop environment. Mainstream
              Linux distributions don't support Trinity at all, but we love it so
               much, that Trinity is even a dedicated download option, right after
               the default Plasma desktop.

              would you like to change the default desktop look and feel ? Install
              Lookswitcher from the software center to get a few original desktop
              themes and a one-click tool to easily switch between them. Select a
              theme you like and enjoy the new desktop appearance.

            <p>
              an exclusive way to put Linux alongside Windows. Just run a setup
              wizard from within Windows and install Q4OS as easily as any other
              application. Although installed within windows, Q4OS kernel can take
              full control of the hardware. That is much more efficient than running
              a virtual machine .. read more

              in addition to the above and what to expect from a regular Debian
              system, Q4OS has got other interesting features. Native Q4OS utilities
              such as Desktop profiler and Software center, installers for third
              party applications, support for x86/32bit as well as ARM architecture
              and even more.
